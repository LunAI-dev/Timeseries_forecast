# üìà Timeseries Forecast

A hybrid time series forecasting pipeline for **revenue and operational KPIs**, designed for realistic business scenarios where interpretability and robustness matter more than novelty.

This notebook is part of an internal data science framework focused on **practical forecasting pipelines**, not academic benchmarks.  
The goal is to test how traditional statistical models (ARIMA, Prophet) can be blended with tree-based methods (XGBoost) to deliver stable, explainable forecasts across different time horizons.

## ‚öóÔ∏è Project Overview

In most business environments, forecasting needs are pragmatic:  
- Short-term accuracy for operations and staffing  
- Medium/long-term stability for budgeting and planning  

This project explores a **hybrid approach** that combines:  
- **ARIMA** for local autoregressive structure  
- **Prophet** for capturing trend and seasonality  
- **XGBoost** for nonlinear relationships and feature-driven adjustments  

By blending these perspectives, the pipeline achieves balanced performance even under noisy or incomplete data conditions.

## üß© Workflow

1. **Synthetic Data Simulation**  
   Generates realistic revenue and operational KPI series with seasonal patterns, promotions, and random noise.  
   Used as a proxy for real-world commercial data with missingness and irregularities.

2. **Exploratory Visualization**  
   Quick look at trends, seasonality, and volatility to understand baseline behavior.

3. **Modeling Stage**  
   - **ARIMA** for short-term signal extraction  
   - **Prophet** for interpretable trend/seasonality capture  
   - **XGBoost** leveraging lag features, rolling stats, and calendar effects  

4. **Hybrid Ensemble**  
   A simple mean blending of the three model outputs.  
   This ensemble often outperforms any single method in both RMSE and robustness.

5. **Diagnostics & Comparison**  
   Evaluates RMSE, MAE, and residual structure.  
   Visual plots show each model‚Äôs strengths and where blending adds value.
